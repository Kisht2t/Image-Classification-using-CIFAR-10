# Image-Classification-using-CIFAR-10

This python notebook uses CIFAR-10 dataset to train a CNN Model on a test set and uses inception block


## Image Classification 

WORK FLOW:

1. Download the CIFAR10- dataset and load the pickled data into your program.
2. Build a basic CNN with several convolution blocks, where each block includes convolution,
pooling, and normalization layers. Flatten the output and pass it through a dense layer that uses
softmax activation. Evaluate the model on the validation set.
3. Replace the convolution blocks with Inception blocks and test the model's performance.
4. Replace the Inception blocks with residual blocks and test the model's performance.
5. Evaluate the algorithm and report results.
